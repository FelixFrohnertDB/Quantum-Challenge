# Quantum-Challenge
The Deloitte Quantum Climate Challenge 2022 aims to explore how the contribution of avia-
tion to the anthropogenic climate change can be reduced by optimizing flight routes using hybrid
quantum-classical algorithms. The case-study includes a sample of multiple flights with different
flight paths and flight schedules. The flight routes are to be optimized in such a way that the
warming of the climate is minimal, taking into account all flights, while at the same time being
compatible with flight safety regulations. Different climate effects occur depending on fuel consumption, the geographic location, flight altitude, weather conditions, and flight times. To solve
this problem efficiently on a quantum computer, the problem was split into two separate combinatorial optimization problems: Finding a set of climate-optimized trajectories and disentangling the
resulting flight plan. The first problem is solved using Groverâ€™s search algorithms, and the second
problem is solved using the filtering variational quantum eigensolver.
