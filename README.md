# Quantum-Challenge
The Deloitte Quantum Climate Challenge 2022 aims to explore how the contribution
of air travel to the anthropogenic (human made) climate change can be reduced by
optimizing flight trajectories using quantum, quantum-classical hybrid, or quantum inspired solutions. The challenge scenario includes a traffic sample of multiple flights with
various paths and schedules. The flight trajectories are to be optimized so that the
overall warming climate effect considering all flights is minimal while being compliant
with flight safety regulations. Different climate effects depending on the fuel burn, the
geographical location, altitude, weather conditions and timings are to be considered. A
detailed problem motivation as well as a description of the mathematical formulation
and the constrains are given in this document.
Please be aware that assumptions and simplifications were made to allow the development of a solution concept and a first algorithm within the given time frame of this
challenge. This concerns in particular - but not exclusively - the description of the flight
parameters and flight regulations.
